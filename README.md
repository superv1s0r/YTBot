Welcome to my little project called - YTBot

I developed it while working with Telegram API, which
is very similar to other APIs like Discord's or Reddit's.

If you want to run your bot, you first need to get your bot's token, set up a database with ytbot table, which will help your bot to store music efficiently.

To install all requirements, just use <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code> 

To use the bot, just <code>python main.py</code> that will ask you all the credentials mentioned before.
